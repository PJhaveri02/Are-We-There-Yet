## Introduction
Are-We-There-Yet (AWTY) is an itinerary visualisation software that not only allows you to plan your trips but see on a map where you would be at a specific point in time. We aim to enhance our users’ trip planning experience by enabling them to visualise their travel plans using our ‘trip preview’ feature. By improving your trip planning, we aim to bring you one step closer to your ideal travel.
